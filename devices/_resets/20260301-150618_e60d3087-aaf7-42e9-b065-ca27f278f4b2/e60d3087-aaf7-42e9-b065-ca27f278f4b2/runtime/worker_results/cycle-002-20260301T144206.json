  "summary": "Advanced task task-20260301-001 by implementing a twice-daily doorstep hazard scan protocol for this device and initializing today's doorstep scan log with three immediate action tips. Local context was determined from machine signals only: `date` reported 2026-03-01T14:42:58+1000 Sunday and `/etc/localtime` points to `Australia/Brisbane` (location confidence: medium, timezone-level only; no external geolocation used). Hardware dependency status: `imagesnap -l` => `No video devices found.`, so machine-observed doorstep conditions cannot be verified this cycle and manual doorway observation remains required in morning/evening windows. Verification evidence: `ls -la devices/e60d3087-aaf7-42e9-b065-ca27f278f4b2/runtime/doorstep_scan` => created `protocol.md` and `scan_log_2026-03-01.ndjson`; Python log validator => `doorstep_scan_log_valid rows=1 tips=3 confidence=unknown slot=setup`; worker result contract validation via `PYTHONPATH=src python3 ... validate_payload(..., 'worker_result.schema.json', label='worker_result')` => `worker_result_schema_valid`.",
