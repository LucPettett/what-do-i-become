Verification evidence: `imagesnap -l` => No video devices found; `ls -la devices/66f110fc-de9e-4d7e-9e4b-5b6da61f4c76/runtime/doorstep_scan` => created `protocol.md` and `scan_log_2026-03-01.ndjson`; `python3` log validator => `doorstep_scan_log_valid rows=1 tips=3 confidence=unknown`; `PYTHONPATH=src python3` contract validation => `worker_result_schema_valid`.
