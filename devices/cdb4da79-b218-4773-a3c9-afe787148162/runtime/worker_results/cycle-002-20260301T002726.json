  "status": "COMPLETED",
  "summary": "Capability discovery completed with machine-observed checks. Root-cause analysis from `/devices/.../state.json` and `events.ndjson` shows prior WDIB runtime failures were caused by: missing `codex` in PATH (incident-001), unsupported `--ask-for-approval` flag usage in `codex exec` (incident-002), and invalid worker result shape (`device_id`/`tasks` and malformed incidents; incident-006). Current environment evidence: `python3 --version && which python3 && which codex && codex --version` => Python 3.13.5, `/usr/bin/python3`, `/usr/local/bin/codex`, codex-cli 0.106.0; `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m wdib --help` and `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m wdib tick --help` both succeed; `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v` => 5 tests passed; normalization/contract verification check succeeded (`normalized_status=BLOCKED`, `proposed_tasks=1`, `incidents=1`, `has_device_id=False`). Additional evidence: `python3 -m pytest -q` failed because `pytest` is not installed."
