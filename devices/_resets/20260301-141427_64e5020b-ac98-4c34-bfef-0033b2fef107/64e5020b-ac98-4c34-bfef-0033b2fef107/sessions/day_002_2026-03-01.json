  "summary": "Advanced task task-20260301-001 by operationalizing a twice-daily doorstep scan workflow for this device and recording today\u2019s initialization scan with concrete action tips while preserving evidence integrity. External research was not required because local repository context and machine commands were sufficient. Verification evidence: `imagesnap -l` => No video devices found; `ls -la devices/64e5020b-ac98-4c34-bfef-0033b2fef107/runtime/doorstep_scan` => created `protocol.md` and `scan_log_2026-03-01.ndjson`; `python3` log validator => `doorstep_scan_log_valid rows=1 tips=3 confidence=unknown`; `python3` schema validator => `worker_result_schema_valid`. This cycle cannot claim machine-observed doorstep conditions because no local video device is available, so task-20260301-001 remains IN_PROGRESS pending morning/evening physical doorway observations.",
