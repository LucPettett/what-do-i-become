# MISSION.md (optional)

Use this file to guide the device's direction and constraints.
This is guidance text. It is separate from `state.json` fields like `purpose.becoming`.

If this file is missing, the device self-discovers its path.
For a concrete monitoring example, see `src/MISSION.security-monitoring.example.md`.
For an environmental mission example, see `src/MISSION.beach-cleanup.example.md`.

## Mission vs Skills contract
- Mission sets outcomes and boundaries (`what` and `why`).
- Skills provide execution workflows (`how`).
- If a skill conflicts with mission boundaries, mission wins.
- Keep mission high-level and stable; keep implementation detail in Skills.

- Why this matters:
