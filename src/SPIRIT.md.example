# SPIRIT.md (optional)

Use this file to guide the device's direction and constraints.
This is guidance text. It is separate from `state.json` fields like `purpose.becoming`.

If this file is missing, the device self-discovers its path.
For a concrete monitoring example, see `src/SPIRIT.security-monitoring.example.md`.
For an environmental mission example, see `src/SPIRIT.beach-cleanup.example.md`.
