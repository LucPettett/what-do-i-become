  "summary": "Root cause identified: worker runtime cannot execute any shell command due to an environment-level sandbox failure (Landlock restriction), so capability discovery and repository verification could not run. Verification evidence: command `pwd && rg --files` failed with `error applying legacy Linux sandbox restrictions: Sandbox(LandlockRestrict)`; command `rg -n \"worker_result|result_schema|runtime failure|WDIB runtime|cycle-001\" -S /home/pi/development/what-do-i-become` failed with the same error; minimal command `date` also failed with the same error. Next concrete tasks to advance purpose once execution is restored: (1) fix worker sandbox/landlock setup so commands can run inside allowed_paths, (2) run capability inventory (`rg --files`, runtime entrypoint discovery, dependency/toolchain checks), (3) reproduce WDIB runtime failures and capture stack traces/log evidence, (4) add/adjust tests before minimal fixes, then rerun concrete verification commands and update incident statuses based on observed pass/fail.",
