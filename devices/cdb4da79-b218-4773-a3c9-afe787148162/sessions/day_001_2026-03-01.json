  "summary": "Execution environment failure prevented all work beyond initial probing. Verification evidence: `pwd && ls -la && rg --files` -> exit 101 with `error applying legacy Linux sandbox restrictions: Sandbox(LandlockRestrict)`; `ls` -> exit 101 with same error; `pwd` (login=false) -> exit 101 with same error. Because shell execution was unavailable, root-cause analysis of WDIB runtime failures, test-first code changes, and in-repo verification could not be performed, and result persistence to result_path could not be machine-verified.",
